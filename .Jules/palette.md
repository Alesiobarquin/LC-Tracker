## 2024-04-07 - Keyboard Accessibility for Styled File Inputs
**Learning:** Using `className="hidden"` on `<input type="file">` removes it from the keyboard focus order, making custom styled file inputs inaccessible to keyboard users.
**Action:** Always use `className="sr-only peer"` on the input and add `peer-focus-visible` styles to its associated `<label>` to maintain keyboard navigation and visual focus indication.
