## 2026-04-09 - Missing rel="noopener noreferrer" on target="_blank" links
**Vulnerability:** Missing `rel="noopener noreferrer"` on links that open in a new tab (`target="_blank"`), specifically using only `rel="noreferrer"` or nothing at all.
**Learning:** Even though modern browsers treat `target="_blank"` as `rel="noopener"` by default, explicitly defining it is crucial for defense-in-depth, support for older browsers, and passing security audits.
**Prevention:** Always include `rel="noopener noreferrer"` when using `target="_blank"`. Use linting rules (like `react/jsx-no-target-blank`) to catch these issues automatically.
