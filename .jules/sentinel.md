## 2026-04-05 - Fix XSS vulnerability in Admin Dashboard image links
**Vulnerability:** The Admin Dashboard rendered user-provided `image_url` directly as an `href` inside an `<a>` tag without proper sanitization.
**Learning:** Even though feedback images are uploaded to Supabase and return valid URLs, an attacker could manually insert a payload like `javascript:alert(1)` into the database or API. Untrusted URLs must always be validated on the client side before rendering in anchor tags.
**Prevention:** Always check if a user-provided URL starts with `http://` or `https://` before rendering it as an `href`.
